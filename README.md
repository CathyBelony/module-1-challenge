# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This was the first BootCamp challenge I had to do to practice my skills.

The first step I had to provide semantics in the HTML file

Next, I added more clarity to the title of the webpage.

 Lastly, I ensured that the order of the headings made sense and that the webpage images were accessible to everyone.
